My expectation for this course is that I will be mentally challenged in dealing with the weekly laboratories as well as in complying with the lecture component's requirements. But most importantly, I expect to have fun and finish this course filled with lots of knowledge in web programming.

- I agree that the course will be mentally challenging, but I personally doubt that I will have fun.
